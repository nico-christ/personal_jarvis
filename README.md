## Speech Recognition Project

This project utilizes the SpeechRecognition library in Python for speech recognition on audio files. It includes functionality to record audio, recognize speech using different engines, and provides a modular structure for easy customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   `git clone https://https://github.com/nico-christ/personal_jarvis.git`
   `cd personal_jarvis`

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the main.py script to test speech recognition.
    ```bash
    `python main.py`

    This will recognize speech using the default Google recognition engine.

2. Customize the recognition engine or parameters in the main.py script according to your requirements.

## Features

- Record audio from specified file paths.
- Recognize speech using different recognition engines (Google, Sphinx, etc.).
- Easily switch between recognition engines by modifying the models dictionary.
